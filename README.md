# Audio File Speed Control

An Anki add-on that permanently speeds up audio files in your cards with pitch preservation, so they play back faster everywhere — not just during review.

## How It Works

Select cards in the browser, pick a speed, preview, and confirm. The add-on re-encodes your audio files using FFmpeg's `atempo` filter and updates your card references to point to the new files. Originals are always preserved.

## Requirements

- Anki 23.10+
- FFmpeg in your PATH
  - macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`
  - Windows: [ffmpeg.org/download](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)

## Usage

1. Open the **Card Browser**
2. Select cards with audio
3. **Edit → Speed Up Audio...**
4. Set speed, optionally preview, click **OK**
